# MarsXR - ArchiDAO

**Vivid Description**
   - Terraforming civilization / space colonization that has moved
   infrastructure and industry off of planet earth
   - Earth is now zoned residential and only optimized for living beings
   - ArchiDAO has aligned towards building this future by enabling the
   platform for decentralized, autonomous design, build, operations, and
   maintenance of new built-environments

**How**
   - Leverage technology accelerators to design, build, operate, and
   maintain sustainable worlds / built environments

**What**
   - Mars settlement funded by earth bound communities leveraging the
   best in class technology to design, build, operate, and maintain the built
   environment
   - Earth bound communities capturing a part of the value that is being
   created on Mars

## **The terraforming of Mars journey / story**

***What 'resource' does Mars have an abundance of which is currently readily available?***
- Land
- 'Potential'

***As an (AEC) ArchiDAO we want to transform the land into usable infrastructure and industry for economic gain and political independence so as to govern ourselves in alignment with the ArchiDAO principles and members.***

***Nation States have already occupied territory on Mars for their own gain but there is still ample space for new settlements, infrastructure and industry.***

### Digi-Mars-Verse - (Digital Mars Metaverse) Mars IRL | Mars Metaverse on-chain

- DAO's (such as ArchiDAO) are formed by Communities on Earth
- Fungible and non-Fungible tokens are created through trustless and transparent smart contracts to raise capital for terraforming Mars through ArchiDAO.
- Capital raised is used to fund initial (robotic) Mars expedition.
- Satellites between Earth and Mars are used as Blockchain / Computational Nodes. (computation in space)
- Deployment of startup infrastructure is pre-designed by ADAO, semi-automated. (Robots, Mobile 3D printing Factories and additional equipment to setup base and basic needs)
- ADAO claims land on Mars to Terraform which is owned by the ADAO members.
- Establish independent political system:
[Anarcho-capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-capitalism#:~:text=Anarcho%2Dcapitalism%20(or%2C%20colloquially,concept%20to%20include%20control%20of))
- Policies, frameworks and systems designed, built, maintained and governed by ADAO and its members.
- After Startup base constructed on Mars, ADAO robots are re-programmed to start constructing domiciles, services and businesses to start creating economic value. (I.E: generating energy, research laboratories for I.P., mineral extraction, etc.)
- ADAO members could choose to migrate to Mars and live in their ADAO governed society. Being off-planet, members can also participate in governance, produce services and goods on Mars through interacting with the Mars Metaverse. (I.E setup energy production which is sold to other Mars colonies or off-world stations for a profit.)
- As more ADAO members join, more Mars land is claimed to be terraformed and the society grows.

### Types of on-chain Tokens
1) Soulbound NFT’s (ERC721): Each ADAO member initiates verifiable credentials to join ($ID-dNFT)
2) Non-Fungible Tokens (ERC721):  Mars NFT land parcels sold to ADAO members and used to design domiciles, businesses and services in the Digi-Mars-Verse for construction on Mars. ($MarsParcelNFT)
3) Fungible Token (ERC20): Energy tokens are also sold to ADAO members to pay for construction costs on Mars ($MarsEnergy)
 
- Each ADAO member must have an $ID-dNFT to participate in ADAO activities such as; buying, selling, renting, swaps of $MarsParcelNFT's and $MarsEnergy, governance activities, etc.
- $MarsParcelNFT's are specific 'volumed spaces' within the terraformed ADAO Mars land claims. An exact digital representation (CryptoTwin) of the 'volumed space' is also minted in the Digi-Mars-Verse (Mars Metaverse - BIM model). 
- $MarsEnergy tokens act as a form of energy exchange currency. 
- $MarsParcelNFT's are used in conjunction with the $MarsEnergy tokens to pay for resources used by ADAO's robots to construct the Metaverse designed NFT on Mars.

4) Fungible Token (ERC20): $MARS (data) token acts mainly as an investment vehicle token for public capitalists to invest in. Data is harvested from all activities happening on Mars, this data is made available to investors and could be along the lines of; Mars settlement conditions, Mars lessons learned, current on-going DAO governance decisions, potential future activities, expansion prospects, etc. As the ADAO Mars economy grows, so does the value (in data as well) of $MARS token.
